# Technical and systems issues

The NVI uses several different technical platforms for our work. This
section details many of them.

## Systems interactions

### R
Most of the R work happens in RStudio on users' local machines. For
more heavy duty work Saga can be used, we also have some inhouse
servers that can be used. Contact the Epi section for more info.

### Research bioinformatics
Most bioinformatics work happen on Saga. See the Saga entries in this
documentation for how to get access and how things are organized.
