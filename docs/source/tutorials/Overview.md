# NVI technical platforms

This section is for tutorials developed at the Institute. Please note that
several of them have been developed with a particular technical platform
in mind. Thus any users should be aware that the tutorials might need 
adjustment to work on other platforms. 

## Saga platform

Saga is the main platform used for bioinformatics work. This is an high
performance cluster offered by [Sigma2](sigma2.no). See other sections of
this documentation for a closer description of how it works and how to 
get access.
